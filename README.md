# SFML_project

Multiplatform minigame that demonstrates SFML library potential.

## Configuring

In file `include/Constants.hpp` you can set pixel and window size up. Keep in mind that real window size is `window size` * `pixel size`.

## Installation

Create a directory for building and build the game inside it: 

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

## Running

After installation there appears `SFML_project` executable file and `textures` directory. Just run `SFML_project` file for starting the game :)

Now you can use `w`, `a`, `s` and `d` buttons for moving across the map.
